<p>The following skills are seen as very important to learn and practice before an MPC</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list and other skills will be required</p>
<li>Navigation at day and night, and in all weather conditions</li>
<li>Tent pitching in the dark and in bad weather</li>
<li>Team work</li>
<li>Walking with a heavy pack</li>
<li>Cooking on a Trangia - not as easy as people think!</li>
